Below is a list of all the achievements available in Fractured Kingdom, ranked roughly by difficulty (from least difficult to most difficult).
There's no reward for collecting achievements, and earned achievements are not saved between playthroughs. They're meant to be fun little challenges/milestones players can accomplish while playing through the mod.
Note that some achievements have conflicting requirements, so it is impossible to get them all in one playthrough.
