# Fractured Kingdom
A mod that adds a new custom campaign to Warzone 2100, with its own self-contained story and events completely disconnected to Warzone 2100's universe and story.

------------------
Spoiler Warning!!!
------------------
It is HIGHLY recommended that you play through the mod's campaign fully at least once before going through the mod's files, or else you might tarnish part of the experience for yourself (This README is spoiler free though!). But if you've already beaten the mod, then feel free to look around!

------------
Installation
------------
After downloading the Fractured_Kingdom.wz file, place it into your `mods/autoload` folder in your main warzone directory (If you can't find the main directory, click "Open Configuration Directory" in the Options menu). After moving Fractured_Kingdom.wz into the autoload folder, launch the game. If you see "Mod: Fractured_Kingdom.wz" in the upper left of the main menu, then you've probably done it correctly. To play without the mod, simply move the Fractured_Kingdom.wz file out of the `autoload` folder.

--------------------
Playing With The Mod
--------------------
To get started, simply click Single Player -> New Campaign -> Fractured Kingdom. Also feel free to change your player color and difficulty in Options -> Game Options. Enabling Shadows and Fog in Options -> Graphics Options is highly recommended, because it looks really cool.
This mod DOES NOT support Skirmish/Multiplayer games! Please disable the mod before trying to play those or else your computer will be sucked into a black hole or something.

With that out of the way, I hope you will enjoy / have enjoyed Fractured Kingdom!
