# Fractured Kingdom
A mod that adds a new custom campaign to Warzone 2100, with its own self-contained story and events completely disconnected to Warzone 2100's universe and story.

------------------
Spoiler Warning!!!
------------------
It is HIGHLY recommended that you play through the mod's campaign fully at least once before going through the mod's files, or else you might tarnish part of the experience for yourself (This README is spoiler free though!). But if you've already beaten the mod, then feel free to look around!

------------
Installation
------------
After downloading the Fractured_Kingdom.wz file, place it into your `mods/campaign` folder in your main warzone directory (If you can't find the main directory, click "Open Configuration Directory" in the Options menu). After moving Fractured_Kingdom.wz into the campaign folder, launch the game. Go to Single Player > New Campaign, and Fractured Kingdom should now show up under "Additional Campaigns".

--------------------
Playing With The Mod
--------------------
To get started, simply click Single Player -> New Campaign -> Fractured Kingdom. Select your difficulty as desired. Also feel free to change your player color in Options -> Game Options. Enabling Shadows and Fog in Options -> Graphics Options is highly recommended, because it looks really cool.

With that out of the way, I hope you will enjoy / have enjoyed Fractured Kingdom!
